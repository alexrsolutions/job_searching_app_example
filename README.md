# How it works
This is an experiment app, its a test dummy for a job searching appIt was developed in Android Studio and the communication between the database and the app are managed by PHP, i didnt use any framework. This part of an assigment in school that was to build an app that worked with a database.

For the database i used MySQL and PHPmyAdmin.
